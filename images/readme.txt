Add your classification images in folders in that the folder-names act as labels for the recognition task.

NOTE: As a convention individual items in the named folders should be given sequential numbers i.e. 

n = 0 # n initialized as 0 therefore first image is 0.jpg and increments by 1 thus next image is 1.jpg ...

# './' means the current folder[images] and Tim is the folder label within the images folder{images/Tim/...jpg}
./Tim/[n++].jpg


After adding your training data delete this file.
